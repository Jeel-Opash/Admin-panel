# TODO: Fix Routing Issues in Admin Panel

- [x] Fix Login.jsx: Change navigate("/") to navigate("/dashboard") after successful login
- [x] Update App.jsx: Remove duplicate route for "/dashboard" pointing to About, and set About as the index route under /dashboard
- [x] Update Home.jsx: Change NavLinks to use relative paths (e.g., to="user" instead of "/user")
